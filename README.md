  -- User can pick which notes they want to practice with by selecting from the checkboxes beside the staff lines
  
  -- User can input name of note from typing keyboard or from any USB midi keyboard device
  
  -- Save chosen notes as a preset so you can systematically work on different areas of the treble and/or bass staff 
  
  -- User chosen notes will then be served to user randomly for 1 minute. +5 for correct answers and -3 for incorrect
  
  -- Pressing 'Learn' button activates learning optimization:
  
      1. After selecting 'Learn', press 'Practice' to start. During 1st round, app will learn users typing strengths and weaknesses
      
      2. On the following round, app will mutate the list to present notes that user had trouble with 50% more often
      
      3. Notes that the user is strong at will be seen less often
      
      4. Continuing rounds with the 'Learn' button activated will continue to mutate list to allow user to focus on weak notes
      
      5. Pressing reset will reset all the keys as well as the mutated learn list
  
  -- This app was intended to allow new music / piano students the ability to learn the staffs by focusing only on note names
